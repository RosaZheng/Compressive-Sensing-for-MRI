# MRI Compressive Sensing Toolbox for MATLAB  

The work was done at Missouri University of Science and Technology, the University of Missouri-Columbia and and Harry S Truman Memorial Veterans’ Hospital.

For more information, contact Dr. Rosa Zheng  (yrz218 at lehigh.edu) or Dr. Lixin Ma  (mal at health.missouri.edu)

To run this program, open the file "MRI_CS_Toolbox.m" in MATLAB and run it.
The GUI should appear, which has a menu available with further help.
